And I paid my debt, Giddons. My conscience is shiny and new. 
Yeah,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000

Bo and Lyle weren't on that job. 
Hm, so the record states. That is real sweet of you

Giddons, all due respect, you're not a detective. You're my PO.

50
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I know that you ride me more than most. Why? 
You're

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
smart. And ain't nothing in this world dumber than a smart guy. A smart man, he sees beyond his

52
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000

As long as you're on parole,

What? What? 
Who is that?

155
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Who said that? 
Stop it. 
Ma'am? 
Who said that? 
Stop this!

156
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Stop this! Stop it! 
Ma'am, your bag. 
Uh oh. Oh, shit.

157
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

158
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it. 
What is this? What's going on? 
Stop it. Stop this. Stop it. 
Hey, shut up!

159
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Can you hear me? Who are you? 
I'm

160
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
sorry. 
I'm sorry? What am I sorry about? What did I do? 
Who are you? 
I asked you that.

161
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I'm looking at a store window. Am I looking at a store window? 
Yes, I am.

162
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Uh, are you me? 
No, no, no, no. You're in my head. You're in my head.

163
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
I'm having, I'm losing. Oh, god. I'm so scared.

164
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Where am I? 
What? 
Where am I? 
Uh, you're on the road. You're on a road. There's

165
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
a truck. I don't understand. What does the truck mean? 
Well, that means I have a truck.

166
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000
It's my truck. I have a truck.

167
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000
You have a truck. 
Yeah. Wow, what do you have? 
What? Oh, I have

168
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
a Range Rover. 
Nice, safe. 
Heh.

169
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I can see out there. I see here too.

170
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
It's like one's close and one's far away. I just focus and

171
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I can see what's here or what's in my head. 
This ain't your head, lady. This is New Mexico.

172
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Wait, you're real. You're a real person.

173
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Oh, that's the sweetest thing anybody's said to me all day. 
I don't understand this.

174
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
It's cold. Wait, are you cold there?

175
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Yeah. It's um, it's almost winter. 
I can feel it. Oh, this is too crazy.

176
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And I can hear you like 
I can hear myself. 
Where are you?

177
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
If you're not in my head, then where are you? 
Exeter, New Hampshire. 
New Hampshire?

178
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Get out of here! Wait a minute. What time is it? You know, what, what day? 
Um,

179
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000
it's Thursday, the um, 24th. 
Okay, well that's today I think. Do you have a watch?

180
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Yeah. 
Oh, my god.

181
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000
You're in the future. You're two hours in the future! 
No. I'm in a different time zone.

182
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Oh, yeah, right. 
Could you hear my thoughts?

183
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I don't know. Uh, think something. 
Okay. What should I think about?

184
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I'm not allowed to tell you. 
Right. Okay.

185
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
You know, I, I got nothing. 
I'm thinking about new sneakers. 
Okay.

186
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000
That's a weird one. Uh, alright. Well, hey, what if we just both. Rebecca, you alright? Hello? You there?

187
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Hi. Chee, Chief Booth. 
You okay? 
Yes.

188
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000
I'm fine. I'm so sorry. I think I fell. I think I'm 
Did you hurt yourself? 
No. I think maybe I had

189
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
bad clams or something. Um, are you, how are you? How's Audrey? 
She's good.

190
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000
She's great. Are you, are you sure you're alright? 
Yeah, I'm, I'm great. I'm great. Maybe if you just um,

191
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
walk me to my car to be sure. 
Absolutely. 
You know. 
Where are you? 
I think I'm parked right over here. 
Are you sure

192
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000
you're okay? 
I'm totally fine. 
Are

193
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000
you there? 
Wow. Uh, guess we got disconnected. 
Yeah,

194
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
someone came and I had to cut you off. 
So, wait, how? 
I mean I could feel you trying to come in. It was

195
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
um, this kind of swimmy feeling at the back of my head, but I could stop it. 
That's good to know.

196
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Yeah. Um, I can't talk here. People are um, staring at

197
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
me. 
Right. Yeah, and assuming I still got a job, I need to get to it, but I mean we got to talk about all this. 
Okay.

198
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Later, though. Um, 7 o'clock? 
Okay. Well, wait. That's uh, that's five the time I'm still at work.

199
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Say, 10? 8, 8 for me? 
Yeah, great, fine, okay. 
Okay. Uh, and if, you know, it doesn't

200
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
work for some reason, then uh, 
It was nice meeting you.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Is it, is it some cause for excitement? 
No, no, no, no. It's just we ate so late. 
Yeah, I told you it was gonna

212
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
be a long day. 
Yeah, I know. No, I was just, I just meant, I just meant you must be tired and thinking about going to bed.

213
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Well, I'm not. Is that okay? 
Of course! 
Good.

Oh, my god. Ah.

220
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Well, yeah, hi. Ha ha. Oh boy, did I not expect this to work. I

221
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
thought I was just. 
I know. I did too. 
Oh, man. Okay. Well uh, heh, I just,

222
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
I spent all day just trying to think why this could be happening. 
So, did you come up with anything? 
Well, you know,

223
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000
one thing did occur to me. Are you, by any chance, Satan?

224
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000
No. I'm, my name is Rebecca. 
That's,

225
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
wow, I didn't even think of that. I'm Dylan. 
Dylan. That's nice.

226
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
That's a nice room. Uh, is this your place? 
Uh, yeah, this is my house.

227
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I mean it's my husband's. 
Your, oh, you're married? Yeah, why not? I mean got a name, could be

228
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
married too. Did you tell him about it? 
Um,

229
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
no. I uh, ahh, I, I just wasn't sure, um. 
Yeah, I mean, I, I

230
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000
maybe it's better if you don't right away. I don't know, this is as hard enough to believe if it's happening to you. 
Yeah,

231
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000
I'm gonna wait. Wait, so,

232
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000
this is your house? 
No, it's, yeah, yeah it is but uh, it's a little messy, heh.

233
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
It's kind of the maid's decade off. Ugh.

234
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Wait, what are you doing? 
It's better

235
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
this way. You shouldn't have to, ahem. I don't really have girls over too much. 
Oh my god,

236
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
I have to ask you, did you um, did you get hit last night on the

237
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
shoulder like, like, really hard? 
Yeah, I sure did. 
Hah. 
Yeah, some bitch was, like, came at me. 
With a pool cue. I,

238
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000

Hi, sorry.

It's Vicky Madden. 
Sss. 
I was just telling her about my smooth move last night. 
Oh, you must tell it really

242
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000
well. 
Yeah, what was that? Ugh, god, yes, the kids sound amazing.

243
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000
I can't believe that. 
That was very smooth. 
Thank you Vicky.

244
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000
So, that was your husband? 
Oh yeah um,

245
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000
yeah that's Phillip. 
Good looking guy. 
Yeah, doctor, he runs the um,

246
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
hospital here. 
Oh, professional man, hahaha. 
Yeah,

247
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I should probably go. 
Oh, oh well uh, do you want to talk again tomorrow?

248
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Okay, but after Phillip goes to work. You're not, like, planning on getting hit again,

249
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
are you? 
Well, let's see, it's not in my book. 
Hehe. 
Nah, that wasn't a thing anyway. The worst I ever took was,

250
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
oh my god. 
What. 
Let me ask you something, did you

251
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
ever go sledding? Did you ever go sledding and get really hurt? 
I hit

252
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
a tree. 
Jesus H. God! I got knocked out cold. I mean I, I

253
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
must have been out for more than a minute. 
I still have the scar. Dylan,

254
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000

never let me go sledding again. Not that I was all that keen to. 
Hey, what about

261
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000
when you were, like, I don't know, maybe 16? I mean, you were all torn up about something. I wanna say it was, like, the

262
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
dead of summer and, I mean, it must have been a killer because I must have been crossed eyed for a month. 
Oh, that is so embarrassing.

263
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000
What? 
I can't tell you it's um, too personal. 
Oh, come on, you got to. You owe me

264
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
a whole July. 
That was ah, Walter,

265
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
my first boyfriend. I was so in love with him. He was 20, you know? I don't know, we

266
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
went out for, like, two months and then he broke up with me right after we, you know. 
Oh, oh,

267
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
no wonder. 
Yeah. I mean, like, right after. 
Ugh, what a

268
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
dick. 
Sorry if I uh, ruined your summer. 
No, it's cool

269
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000
I was, you know, pretty used to having, like, weird moods and, you know, stuff I couldn't really explain. 
Yeah, me too.

270
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000

Yeah, a lot of people get us mixed up. 
Hahaha.

271
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I remember some other stuff too. Uh, I don't know, I guess it's all kind of personal, like, your mom.

272
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Yeah, that figures. 
You were in college, right? 
Yeah,

273
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.000
she wasn't ever very well. She was like me kind of? Um,

274
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000
not much of a physical specimen. Dylan, there's something,

275
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
didn't make any sense to me at the time but, you know, I always felt like there was someone with me. You know,

276
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
just like a feeling. I felt it um, more strongly than ever after she died.

277
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000
It helped. Did you ever feel that way? 
Why don't you tell me?

278
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000

286

show me.

Cause I asked first.

God, you are beautiful.

295
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Oh, don't be stupid. 
Yeah, no, when I said beautiful, like, I meant, you know, ugly, wart covered, right, what did I say?

296
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Just don't flatter me because I stuck it out in prison with you. 
What are you talking about? Hey look, I was having fun being a beautiful

297
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
girl there. I was all ready to go buy hats or something. Go back. 
No, no, it's your turn.

298
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Hold on, just give me a second. 
It's your turn.

299
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Read 'em and weep.

300
00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000
You've got such a nice face.

301
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Nice, huh. 
Oh, no. I mean yeah, it is. 
Well,

302
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000
it ain't much but it does cover my unsightly skull. So, that's a plus.

Hi. 
Hi

305
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000
No, no, no

306
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
it's nothing like that. We um, we actually met when he, when he lectured at my

307
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000
school. I know, it sounds terrible, but it was really nice. We just got

308
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:56.000
along great and. 
What did you say? 
Oh, nothing um, I was, the phone. Uh, did you figure it out? I, I wish I

309
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000
could describe it better. It was like a, a chugging noise? 
Yeah, 
Like, a maybe. 
I know. What it is, you got a crack in your manifold. They go on you. You need to

310
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000
replace it. 
Okay. 
Now, let me check my stock and uh, probably rack you up today huh? 
Yeah, that's great. 
Excellent. 
Thank you.

311
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000
What year's your truck? 
Oh, a, a 2010. 
There's no way the exhaust system on a Range Rover would go after

312
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000
just a few years. Here turn her over. Okay, now go look under the hood.

313
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Like, wha, what, now? 
No, after he charges you twelve hundred bucks. Yeah, come on.

314
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000

315
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Okay, what are we looking at?

316
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Okay, that sounds like it could just be the sensor got loose. So, that should be over by the ABS. 
I

317
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
don't know what that is. 
Oh, that, that, that, that boxy thing there. 
Okay, over here?

318
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Mmm, no. Okay, try the other side. 
Over here? 
Uh, it's like a

319
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
multi-prong thing. You're looking for, like, a multi-prong plug in thing. See that? Yeah, yeah, that's it.

320
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
What do we do with it? 
Yeah, look, it's loose. Plug it in. There's your problem right there. Hah.

321
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000
The sound stopped. 
Yep. 
That's it? 
That's it. 
I fixed it. 
Yes you did darlin'.

322
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Hey, we're in luck, I can take you today. 
We are in luck. The intake and exhaust manifolds are both fine. The

323
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
um, uh, 
Sensor. 
sensor just needed tightening. 
I don't think that's going to do you much good in the long run. But, yeah,

324
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
I can take care of it for you. 
No, that's alright. I already did it. Thanks Dan.

325
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000

Kershaw, so, how's the auto cleansing business treating you? 
Actually, I've been thinking about

345
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000
looking for some new work. 
Who with? Bo, Lyle? 
I wanna see if I can't scare up something better. I mean, I ain't gonna quit or nothing,

346
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000
not 'til I'm sure, but. 
What's with you? You got a funny look.

347
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000
What? 
You look like you're about to kiss me. 
Well, I mean, when the light hits you like that, something about your head.

348
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Well, solicitation is a crime. So, what's going on Kershaw? 
Nothing's going on.

349
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
For such a smart man you are a piss poor liar.

350
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I met someone.

351
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Well it is, yeah. You're getting your pecker waxed, huh? She know you're a con? 
She

352
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.000
doesn't seem to mind. 
Oh, you got you one of them classy women. 
You'd be surprised. 
Nothing you do

353
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.000
could surprise me. Over there.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.000

355
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.000
I like that you told him you had a girlfriend. 
Yeah well, some people will believe anything. 
Come on, you've had girlfriends.

356
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Nothing that lasted more than a few days. Just not good with women. 
What about

357
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:39.000
your man needs. 
Becky! You got a mind like a sewer. 
Haha.

358
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Shoot. 
Move the other 6 back and then you can move that one over. 
No dummy, that's cheating. 
It's not

359
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.000
cheating, it's creative. 
It's no fun to cheat. It's no fun if you win. 
Only reason you don't cheat is cause

360
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
you're afraid someone will get mad. Can't always do what you're told darlin'. 
Spoken like a true convict.

361
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
I'm sorry. 
What, no, no, it's yeah, it's okay. I,

362
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:14.000
I got no right to be touchy, it's all true.

363
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Oh, hey uh, I think I figured it out. You know,

364
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.000
why it happened or why we opened it up when we did. 
Really? 
Really. 
Why? 
Why not?

Uh, I gotta go Becky. I got

367

something I gotta do. 
Okay, I'll see you.

Grooming Tech Supply, the bitch is ripe Dylan. 
Is it? 
You know our cousin Adam, the one who beat that aggravated

369
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
assault charge against a 7-11 clerk? 
Kicked his lard ass all up and down the freezer section? 
He's been working maintenance in the office park. He says Grooming

370
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.000

Don't it just make your

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.000

I don't know. I mean, you know Giddons is just drooling for me to make a move like this. 
Ah, don't worry about Guiddence, he'll sleep through it. Your end is two hours at most.

372
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000
You open up the pearly gates we handle the rest. You don't want to be seen with us. Yeah, I get it, I get it man. Hell, we'll

373
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.000
mail you your cut. 
I could use some walking around money. 
Yeah, but this is more than just walking around money we got a fence lined up in Wilbur Field,

374
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
it's gonna buy the whole lot. Your parole gets through, this is you setting up in a new town

Look, what else you gonna do, man? You just gonna wax a bunch of Caddies?

378
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Dylan, this was your idea. When you got out you asked for some action, something to get back on your feet, something safe. Now,

379
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000
this is way the hell out in Bedlow and all that equipment is just sitting there. It ain't nobody's, it's going to rust. There's no

380
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:20.000
victim here. 
Just a true convict. 
Dylan, we let you in on this because you asked. Now, I don't like you knowing

381
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.000
if you don't have a stake in it. We'll be waiting on you boy.

get in these places. 
Yeah, I do, which is why I'm surprised to see you here. Everything alright? 
Yeah, everything's fine. I was

390
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
around and I had a wild notion you might be free for lunch? 
Uh, I. 
It's a pretty wild notion.

Doctor Maynard. 
Do you two have plans? 
Oh, no um, I just

396
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.000
need to remember to call ahead first if I'm going to be spontaneous. 
Hehe. 
I see. 
Okay,

397
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
I'll just leave you guys then. 
Okay, I, I shouldn't be late for diner. 
Okay and um, I'll see you Thursday at the fund raiser. 
I look forward to it.

Mmm. 
It's hard to tell right off.

399
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Yeah, I wish you could have spent more time with her. It's, I didn't know she was coming. 
Well, I see what you're talking about. Her,

400
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:40.000
her body language is very protective, very concealing. 
Mm hmm. 
She's deeply uncomfortable.

401
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:47.000
It's odd. 
Yeah, she's always been skittish,I d, I just, I don't know.

402
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Wait, wait, who's this guy? 
That's my friend Mike, his mufflers been busted for eight years so everyone knows what he's doin'.

403
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
And that is Bob Breezy. We call him, yep, Breezy Bob.

Not to hear it.

411
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.000
she's waving. 
I know. 
You guys are friends, ask her out. 
I'm not gonna just ask her out. 
Dylan, don't be a wuss, you know you want her.

412
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.000

Look she's coming over. What is this strange power you have over women? 
If you don't shut up I'm gonna

413
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000
shut you out. 
You better not, not when our girlfriend's here. 
Hey Dylan. 
Come to me wench. 
Hey Donna. 
Hey,

414
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Are you, are you uh, here alone? 
Oh, Jenny's supposed to be coming, but. Haven't seen you around

415
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000

Haven't been around. 
Duh, say you like her shoes. 
Uh, I like your shoes.

416
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:32.000
They, they're, they work. 
I can't believe you noticed them. I got them on sale. They pretty much go with everything I own.

417
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.000
See? You compliment them on something they did or bought, not their eyes or something they were born with. That's how they know that you like them.

418
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000
You like their taste, you like their. 
Shut up. 
Hmm? 
Oh, I just hate this song. 
You're

419
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.000
joking. This is, like, my favorite song. 
Oh, I know, I just have heard it just so many times. 
Oh yeah, that's true, they do play it a lot.

420
00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Ahh, ask her out. Ask her out. Ask her out. 
Say, Donna, I was thinking

421
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:07.000
uh, are you, are you busy Tuesday night? 
I'm busy most nights.

422
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Oh, mm. 
What'd you have in mind? 
Oh, I just thought

423
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.000
that uh, 
I could cook for you. I could cook for you. 
I could cook you dinner? 
You cook?

424
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Yeah, I mean uh, well, a thing or two. What do you like? 
Um, well, I like steaks,

425
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000
big steaks. 
Alright, alright, yeah, I could uh, I'll fix you up. A rare steak with a fancy sauce

426
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:42.000
and trimmings for days. I could, if you're not too busy. 
I am so smooth. 
Tuesday I'm seeing my mom, but I think Thursday

427
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:49.000
I'm free. 
Done, dinner at 6:30. 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm busy Thursday night. 
You're not coming. 
Agh.

Okay gotta go. See you. Hey.

429
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Phillip and I have a fund raiser Thursday night you dope. 
Yeah, what, you think I want you coming on my date telling me how to kiss and stuff? 
Who made you ask her out? You couldn't even

430
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.000
talk to her. You're nothing without me. 
Still not coming. 
I made you and I can break you. 
Hahaha.

431
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Mmm.

434
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
This event is going to be so great for your Narcotherapy project. 
A charity donation is just like any other

435
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:45.000
investment. You want to know your money is being put to good use. 
Wow, you, you know, I can't think of a better place to put your money than in the research

436
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:52.000
fund. 
Well, of course you can't. Your husband's on the board. Hahaha. 
Hahaha. 
Hahaha. 
You know, you're right. The

437
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:59.000
people are always the best. Real lump in the throat stuff, these hospital charities. Give me cripples every time. 
Uh,

438
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:06.000
these are psychos not cripples. But, you know um, would you mind, excusing me just a minute? 
Uh, uh. 


439
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:13.000
How's it

440
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.000
going? 
What? 
How's it going? 
Oh, I'm fine. Yeah, why? What do you want?

441
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Nothing, I'm just checking in, seeing how it's going. 
Ah, everything is great. 
The sauce is burning.

442
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Phh, this is nuts. I haven't cooked anything that didn't take microwave instructions since, ever.

443
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Okay, smell this. 
Ah, what is that, rosemary? 
Yeah, too much?

444
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:48.000
No, no, it's a little thick tough. 
Yeah, it said it's supposed to be thick. 
Yeah but just maybe not, like,

445
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:55.000
as thick as a brick.

446
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.000
What. Oh, you hate this shirt. 
No it's, it's. 
Aw, this is the wrong shirt.

447
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Women everywhere revile this shirt. 
Dylan, maintain, the ties a little rodeo. But it's gonna

448
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.000
be okay. 
Yeah, easy for you to say. How's your money dinner? 
Ugh, you know, stuffed shirts anonymous. I just have to worry

449
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.000
about not falling asleep. 
Shit. 
Hey you're gonna be great. Good

450
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:30.000
luck. 
Thanks.

451
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Hi. 
Hey there. 
Good, how are you? Welcome to. Oh, shit.

452
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Hold on.

453
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Okay, everything, no that's good. Yeah, that'll be great, yeah. Come on in. 
Okay

454
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Never seen your place before.

455
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:05.000
haven't? I thought, you you weren't out here for the 4th? 
I don't think so. 
Oh, I thought you were. 
Nn. 
Yeah,

456
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000
I had a barbecue. It's kind of my own concept, barbecue on the 4th of July. 
Lots of people do that.

457
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Uh, I uh, oh, I li, I really like like your, your shoes.

458
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:26.000
You got a thing for feet? Dated a guy like that once, real weirdo. 
No,no I don't. Uh, would

459
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.000
you like, can I get you something to drink? I did uh, pick up some red wine, if you like? 
Oh, you got a beer?

460
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll take one of those, actually. 
Here. 
Thanks. It's a twist, yeah. Cheers.

461
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Cheers. So, you really

462
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:54.000
cook and everything? 
Now and then. 
Eww, heh, what's this?

463
00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:01.000
It's a sauce. 
Heh, that smells kind of crazy. 
Ugh,

464
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:08.000
bimbo. 
Well, it's not for tonight, heh. 
Okay.

465
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Yeah, I don't like my steaks all fancy. Just burnt black with tons of ketchup. 
Mmm. 
Ugh,

466
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:22.000
figures. 
Figures what? 
Sorry? 
Uh, I thought you'd spoken. 
Oh

467
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:29.000
gosh, I, I , maybe I did. I think I was. Woa!

468
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Shhh. Oh. No. 
Hot, hot. 
Ya, shit, oh. 
In the sink. 
Ooh. 
Put it in the sink

469
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:43.000
God, dang it. 
In the sink. 
Ow. 
In the sink. 
Ow. 
Ahh! oh.

470
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000
There, happy now?

471
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Me? 
Maybe you better go wash that off honey. 
Stay out of this Phil.

472
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Oh god, I'm so sorry. 
Uh, yeah, why don't you go to the bathroom and

473
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:11.000
collect yourself. 
I'm so sorry. Uh, you're right, honey. 
It's okay, it's okay.

474
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:18.000
You guys okay? 
yeah, yeah. 
Did you get anything on you? 
No, I'm fine but, is she alright? 
Yeah, she's fine.

475
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:25.000
She's fine.

476
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Who's Phil? 
Just give me a second.

477
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Okay. 
What did you think you were doing? 
I told you not to come along anyway. I had everything

478
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:46.000
under control. 
You had everything on fire. 
Yeah well, that's the way I like it. 
Sure, burnt black, tons of ketchup. 
It's none of your business what

479
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.000
she eats you yuppie snob, that's my date. 
Hell, well, you know, you sure know how to pick 'em. 
What's the matter? Are you

480
00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000
jealous? 
Hahaha, no. I'm not jealous. 
Then butt out! 
Why don't you make me?

481
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Just make me. 
You think I won't? 
Yeah, sure, try.

482
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Ahh. 
There. 
That's all you got? 
Uh huh. 
Stop it. 
Did it again. Did it again.

483
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Dylan, stop, stop it. 
I won't no, not going to. I won't.

484
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Hey Donna, 
Hey, 
Hey. I just uh, put on some aftershave. Heh, just

485
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000
freshen up a little. 
I'm gonna go. 
Donna!

486
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Dylan? 
Donna wait!

487
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
I was just making a joke. I was just putting on aftershave.

488
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000
[Sigh]

489
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Ugh.

490
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.000
You are going to speak to me

491
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:17.000
again before we die, right? 
What do you want me to say Rebecca? Thank you, I'm so glad you made us look like idiots.

492
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:24.000
You didn't even apologize to Doctor Maynard. 
I don't like Doctor Maynard. He always looks at me like he's trying to guess my weight. 
He was trying to raise

493
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.000
money for an important project I happen to be involved with. 
Phillip I can't say what hapenned.

494
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000
I think, maybe I dozed off for a second. I was confused. Haven't you ever

495
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:45.000
done that? 
That's not it. I mean, that may be true but

496
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:52.000
something is happening to you and I don't know if it's what happened before, or 
It's not,

497
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:59.000
not. 
believe me. 
Okay, then what? What?

498
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:06.000
I don't know Phillip sometimes, sometimes you just look

499
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.000
at everything and it's all just different. Do you know? 
Yeah, I do. They

500
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000
call that puberty. 
No, it isn't just then. It never stops. It's like um,

501
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:27.000
like shedding your skin. 
That, that what you're doing?

502
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Shedding? 
Yeah, I guess, sort of.

503
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Shedding me? 
Ahh, no.

504
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000
No.

505
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:55.000

Hey. 
Hi.

517
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I'm really sorry. I know, I messed it up, I know. 
No, no, it's cool. I would have

518
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
messed it up myself anyway. You just saved me time. 
Give yourself a little credit. That girl really likes you. 
Well, if she did I think

519
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000
she got over that pretty quick when she caught me talking to the little man inside my head. 
Sigh, yeah, right.

520
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It's just sometimes when I'm with you I forget myself.

521
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You feel funny. 
What? 
Don't you

522
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
feel funny? Like, not, not a fever but. 
Oh, I um,

523
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I was uh, previously engaged in a certain kind of activity, and um. 
Nope, hah,

oh, uh. Well, you smell nice,

525
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
kinda sweaty. Sorry, that uh, that was out of

526
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000
line. I didn't uh. 
I should go.

527
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Okay um, look I'm sorry about tonight. 
Yeah me too.

528
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.000

Number seven, how does your partner rate as a lover? 
Pass. 
No wait. 
Pass. Pass. Pass. That's none of your

533
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
your business. 
Of course it's my business. Hush up. You describe your love making as A. Wild animals. B. Sweet

534
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and slow. C. At least he tries. D. 
Who's he talking to?

Um,

No, pass. 
Why?

Hello. 
Hi,

No, this is dancing.

547
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Uh, yeah, it is. Uh, okay um. 
I'll see you.

548
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So, what brings the party down here? 
I, I was just looking for my old photo albums. I thought they were in the

549
01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000
corner. 
Uh, yeah. Yeah, la uh, last time I saw them they were. God, I hope Brigitte didn't throw them out.

550
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
No, that doesn't make any sense. She would ask. 
Hey, you know, I ran into Dianne. She said you were going to do the

551
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.000
painting class. 
The drawing class. 
The drawing class yeah. 
Yeah I don't have to. 
What? No, I think that's great. You know, get

552
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000
you out of you, the cellar. 
Why would Brigitte throw out my

553
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
photos? 
No, no, I'm not saying, just, you know, whatever, by accident. What do you want with them anyway? 
Nothing I just wanted to show them

554
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:38.000
to, to ,to um, myself, look at them. 
I mean,

555
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I, I'm not saying don't find them. It's a healthy thing. That's good. And actually, I, I, I can help you look for them. I, I have my uh, council

556
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000

Yes it will.

557
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Thank you for knowing that about me.

558
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Hey, is my uh, gray shirt clean? 
Yeah, oh, yeah, I'll check. 
Thank you.

Where is old Phillip?

Yeah, you have.

Hey, did you find the pictures you were going to show me? 
Mmm, ahh.

568
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:16.000
furnished house. Maybe the maid ate them or maybe my husband slipped them

569
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
into the trash. 
What, are you serious? Why the hell would he do that? 
Because he knows me.

570
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Phillip takes care of me. 
That's not ta, that's. That sucks. 
He's not being mean.

571
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:37.000
He knows how funky I get sometimes looking through that stuff.

572
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Doesn't matter anyway. I know them all by heart. There's my mom when she's little.

573
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.000
She has my eyes, blue gray with flecks of panic. And here's mom teaching me how to

574
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:58.000
swim. 
Hmm. 
Notice how I'm grafted to her arm. Not a success.

575
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And there's a picture of a pony, hehe, I don't know why it's in there. Who it belonged to but

576
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:12.000
there it is anyway. And there's my dad.

577
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Scariest man who ever lived. Grownups were scared of him.

578
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:26.000
All they ever taught me was how to be afraid. And I went out and found

579
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
the copingest man alive so he could take care of me,

580
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
so he could get rid of the past. Chipping away at it.

581
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000
All my little quirks and insecurities until

582
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:54.000
voilà, nothing left.

583
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Ha!

584
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Nothing like a little truth to sober you up, huh?

585
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Tell you about my family. I got a brother uh, named Mitch.

586
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I think he lives down in Louisville now. Moved 1,500 miles away so that he wouldn't have to loan me any more money.

587
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000
My mom, I just, I put her through so much. By the time I got popped she had stopped

588
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000
talking to me. She didn't even wait for the trial. I've

589
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.000
never met anyone I didn't disappoint. I mean, the best thing,

590
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the only thing about me that I like, is you.

You know what, you don't have to tell me who. That just explains everything.

Everybody's

I never came here again.

691
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I was scared. It just felt like there was something

692
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:44.000
here. Something too grown up,

693
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:51.000
too real. Do you think this the place I first went nuts or does it go

694
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
further back? 
Come on, you're not crazy Becky. 
I was once. Right after college

695
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.000
before Phillip and I were engaged. I

696
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:12.000
kind of fell apart. Couldn't deal with being in the world.

697
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:19.000
So, I spent some time in a hospital upstate,

698
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:26.000
rehabilitating. 
I didn't know about that. 
Yeah, you missed that one.

699
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Probably cause I missed most of it too. I couldn't feel anything.

700
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I just laid in bed for three months trying to work up enough

701
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000
energy to cry. Phillip was with me

702
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.000
through all of it. He read to me. He sat with me. Tried to get me

703
01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:01.000
through it. He probably did.

704
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Sure wasn't me. I'm so goddamn weak. 
Becky,

705
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.000
how can you say that. I mean, what you did for me. 
Have I made your life any easier? Honestly?

706
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yes. 
You know,

707
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I can't read your mind Dylan but I know when you're lying. 
Becky, don't do this. 
I can't

708
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:36.000
live like this. Dylan, Phillip is my husband.

709
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I know you don't like him but I need to be with him. I need to

710
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.000
find him again. 
Yeah, you gotta do what you're told, right? 
That's not fair. 
Fair? I finally,

711
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:57.000
for once in my life I can see something, something real and then you tell me I gotta give, give it up. So,

712
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:04.000
how do you come at fair? 
I can't be with you and I can't

713
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000
play at this any more. 
It's not a game. It's not something that you play. What am I supposed to do?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
You are going to be fine. God, Dylan

716
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:32.000

717
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I'm never going to forget that. 
Couldn't we just. 
No.

How do you expect me to just shut you off?
